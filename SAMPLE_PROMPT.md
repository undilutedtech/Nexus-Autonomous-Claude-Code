Let's call it Simple Todo. This is a really simple web app that I can use to track my to-do items using a Kanban
board. I should be able to add to-dos and then drag and drop them through the Kanban board. The different columns in
the Kanban board are:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

The app should use a neobrutalism design.

There is no need for user authentication either. All the to-dos will be stored in local storage, so each user has
access to all of their to-dos when they open their browser. So do not worry about implementing a backend with user
authentication or a database. Simply store everything in local storage. As for the design, please try to avoid AI
slop, so use your front-end design skills to design something beautiful and practical. As for the content of the
to-dos, we should store:

- The name or the title at the very least
- Optionally, we can also set tags, due dates, and priorities which should be represented as beautiful little badges
  on the to-do card Users should have the ability to easily clear out all the completed To-Dos. They should also be
  able to filter and search for To-Dos as well.

You choose the rest. Keep it simple. Should be 25 features.
